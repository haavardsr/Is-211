--- START description ---

1. A constant number N of elements in the structure is 100;
2. Allocate memory for 100 elements of type integer in a variable buf;

3. Define the variable end (of type integer) and initialize it with the value of 0;
4. Define the variable start (of type integer) and initialize it with the value of 0;

5. Define the put method which takes one argument that represents the contents of an element (item of type integer) and with a void return;
6. In the method assign the variable item with the value of the end + 1 position in the buf, and assign the end with the remainder of itself when divided by N ( end = end % N );

7. Define the get method with no arguments and returning a value of an integer;
8. In the method assign the value of the start + 1 position in the buf to the local variable item (type of integer), and assign the value of the reminder from the division of the variable start with N ( start = start % N ), and return the value of item.
